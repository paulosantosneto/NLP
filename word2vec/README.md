# Word2vec

`Warning` This is my implementation of the articles ['Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) and ['Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases
and their Compositionality'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf). Therefore, it is not an official repository of it. Any code improvement recommendations are welcome.
